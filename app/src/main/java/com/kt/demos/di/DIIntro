//Dependency injection
What is dependency - > one class is depend to another class is called dependency

(Engine + Wheel) *-> Car (Here car is depend for engine and wheel so in other word Engine and wheel class is the car class dependency)



what is injection - If you don't want to create object many time then use injection

For eg. I have 10 car  classes and i need to apply engine and wheel class in car class so you dont want to again and again make object then you can use injection
